        <h1>DAY 1: AIRPORT TO SELFOSS</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">When an email came through via <a target="_blank" href="https://scottscheapflights.com">Scott's Cheap Flights</a> I jumped on it. We flew from from Charlotte to Boston to Reykjavik and hit the ground running. The Blue Lagoon was our first stop, and I recommend making reservations ahead of time.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Next, we hiked our way to Bruarfoss Waterfall. After parking, it's a 2 mile hike (one way) to the falls. There are sporadic signs, and sometimes you'll be walking on a road vs a trail, but keep going and you'll get there. The payoff is worth it.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We had the most amazing duck pizza for dinner at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kaffikrus.is">Kaffi Krus</a>. One thing to keep in mind is that no one brings you the check - whenever you're ready, just go to the front counter and they'll ring you up.</p>

        <h1>DAY 2: SELFOSS TO VIK</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">This route contains a few waterfalls. First was Seljalandsfoss Waterfall - even though it was early, the tourists had already started congregating. It's right off the road and you can pay to park fairly close. There's also a food truck where we ordered some delicious lamb soup and hot chocolate. Next was Skógafoss Waterfall. You can get a great view just from the ground, but there are some steep steps to the top if you're feeling adventurous.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We went to Vik first and walked along the black sand beach from that side before going back to our rental at Reynisfjara Beach. The beaches are amazing and were very ethereal looking when we were there due to the fog. To save money along the way, we hit a grocery store and bought sandwich makings.</p>

        <h1>DAY 3: VIK TO HOFN</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon was unfortunately closed, so we drove on to <a href="https://www.vatnajokulsthjodgardur.is/en/areas/skaftafell">Vatnajökull National Park</a>. There are two hikes: Svartifoss Waterfall and Falljökull Glacier, and we did the latter. It was a cool hike, but by May, most of the glacier had melted.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">One of my favorite places on the trip was Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon, I cannot recommend it enough. We just sat on the edge for awhile and watched the glaciers roll in. There's also really good bird and SEAL watching. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">We had the best meal while here: lamb shepherd's pie. I never liked lamb until this meal - it's always been too gamey. But fresh, Icelandic sheep is amazing.</p>

        <h1>DAY 4: HOFN TO EGILSSTADIR</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">This was a fairly uneventful, but still beautiful, drive. We ended up taking a long route due to being in a small hatchback - some of the roads get steep if you veer away from Route 1. We pulled off a few times for pictures, and stopped at the adorable <a href="http://havari.is">Havarí Cafe & Hostel</a> for coffee.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">From Egilsstadir, we continued on to <a href="https://www.borgarfjordureystri.is/en/puffins">Borgarfjordur Eystri</a>, an amazing puffin colony. We were able to get very close to them. I will say that the road to Borgarfjordur is a bit harrowing if you're not used to gravel roads and steep grades. I had an excellent lamb sandwich nearby at the <a href="https://www.blabjorg.com/en-us">Blaborg Guesthouse</a></p>

        <h1>DAY 5: EGILSSTADIR to AKUREYRI</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">On our way to Akureyri, the first stop was <a href="https://guidetoiceland.is/travel-iceland/drive/dettifoss">Dettifoss Waterfall</a>(west side). There's a trail to Selfoss Waterfall as well. </p>

        <p class="paragraph">The Myvatn area is unlike anything we'd ever seen. We hit the Krafla Lava Fields, Hverir (boiling mud pits and sulfuric gas), and had lunch along Mývatn Lake at <a href="https://www.vogafjosfarmresort.is">Vogafjós Cowshed Cafe</a>. There are a lot more sites in the area than what we hit.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">For dinner, we hit <a href="http://www.strikid.is">Restaurant Strikið</a> for some delicious langoustine sushi. Our room at the hostel was pleasantly surprising - all their private rooms are on the top floor - and we were able to get some laundry done while having a beer.</p>

        <h1>DAY 6: AUKREYRI TO HVAMMSTANGI</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">In the morning, we checked out and then went to the docks for a whale watching tour aboard a traditional oak boat. We saw a humpback whale and followed it for about an hour, but I would've been just as happy sailing along in the fjord if we hadn't seen anything.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Aukrekyi was the first real town we hit after arriving, so it was nice to be back amoungst people. After meandering around town for a bit, we set off on another very scenic drive to Hvammstangi. There aren't a lot of restaurant options, and we had a lovely meal at <a href="https://www.sjavarborg-restaurant.is">Sjavarborg.</a></p>

        <h1>DAY 7 + 8: HVAMMSTANGI TO REYKJAVIK</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">After a week of being on the move, we were exhausted and ended up cutting our the Kirjufell Area to head straight for Reykjavik for 2 nights. On the way, we stopped at Barnafossar Waterfall, and later hiked a bit at Esjan Mountain.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Iceland has the most fantastic food, and <a href="http://www.tapas.is/">Tapas Barinn</a> didn't disappoint. I will admit that I had puffin - and it was delicious. We also ate at <a href="http://messinn.com">Messinn</a>, and had drinks at both <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/edit?mid=1Lk_zhWrSXxU_ZOpM8SbybuDGMws&ll=64.14598807571338%2C-21.94205155812324&z=15">Kaldi</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/skulicraft/about/?tab=overview">Skuli Craft Bar.</a></p>
