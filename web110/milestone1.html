 <h2 id="topic">Overall topic: An Abridged Guide to Vanlife</h2>     

<p><strong>What is the purpose of the site?</strong> To provide insight on how to start living in our traveling out of a van, and why more people are turning to this lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>What do you want the web site to accomplish?</strong> I want to provide guides on what to look for when buying a van, how to gut it, build ideas, product recommendations, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What opportunity, problem, or issue is your site addressing?</strong> With older vans, it's difficult to find a build that mirrors the van you have. With this site, I can provide ideas and inspiration for others that have a 97" Chevy Express, or similar model.</p>
<p><strong>Who is your intended audience? Be specific.</strong> Anyone looking to get on the road and travel, but specifically those looking into vanlife and how to make that happen. Millenials are likely the key demographic - due to rising house costs and stagnant wages, they're unable to afford houses and are looking at alternatives to renting. </p>
<p><strong>What type of content might be included in your site? Be specific.</strong> Buying Guide, Build Ideas (gutting, insulation, decorating, etc), Trip Ideas, What's the Appeal (cost of living comparisons). There will be in-depth images documenting the build process and for DIY pages.</p>
