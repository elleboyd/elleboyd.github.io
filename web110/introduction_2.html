	<ul>
	<li><strong>Background:</strong> I'm from Bloomington, IL, and moved to Charlotte in 2011 for a job after graduating. My husband, Andy, and I got married in 2016, and we have two awesome dogs. </li>
	
	<li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I have a B.S in Graphic Design from Illinois State University.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I'm a Quality Assurance Manager at a print company and while it pays the bills, it's not exactly fulfilling. I've worked at a variety of studios in Charlotte as a freelancer, but got burnt out on it. I mostly do design work now for friends that need logos and wedding invitations. I used to work in a letterpress studio, and love operating an old Vandercook press - if it had paid better, that's where I'd be.</li>

	<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Macs, all day every day.</li>
	
	<li><strong>Courses I'm taking, and why:</strong> 
	<ul>
	<li><strong>WEB 110-85:</strong> We'd like to travel around the country via van, and this is step one in being able to have marketable skills that can be done remotely. The goal is to be a full-stack developer.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li><strong>Something to remember me by:</strong> I love ocean fishing, and one time, caught a barracuda. Turned it into delicious tacos.</li>

	<li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> I spend most of my free time playing videogames, building our travel van, or watching campy teen shows on the CW.</li>
	</ul>
