        <h1>CARGO VANS</h1>
        <h3>There are two types of cargo vans: passenger ones that have windows and seats, or panel ones that have no windows. They offer a lot of flexibility as far as height and length, and interior customizability.</h3>

            <li><span class="bold">COST:</span> $-$$</li>
            <li><span class="bold">PROS:</span> These come in a lot of shapes and sizes. Compact and extended length options are available, as well as hi-top roofs. Also easy to stealth camp.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">CONS:</span> Poor gas mileage on older models. No bathroom, unless you make room for a portable toilet.</li>

        <h1>CONVERSION VANS</h1>
        <h3>Typically designed with road trips in mind, most have hi-top roofs for extra room and large windows already. If you're anxious to hit the road, most also have a bench seat that folds down into a bed in the back.</h3>

            <li><span class="bold">CONS:</span> Older models can have some interesting exterior colors and designs. The inside will most likely need to be gutted if you want a more modern look (which is also a pro if you like projects).</li>
