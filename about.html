    <h1>Hello! We are Andrew and Elyssa Boyd.</h1>
    <h3>Originally from Bloomington, Illinois, we met in high school. Now, 15 years later, we live in Charlotte, North Carolina with our two dogs. Traveling has always been a passion of ours, and being frugal, we wanted a solution where we could travel freely with our dogs and not have to board them or find hotels constantly. So naturally, we bought a van.</h3>

    <h4>OUR BUYING STORY</h4>

<div id="grid-container-3">
    <div class="info-right">
        <p class="paragraph">We've been contemplating vanlife for years, ever since we stumbled upon <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gonewiththewynns.com">Gone with the Wynns</a>. We finally got to the point where if we didn't start now, we likely never would. I started combing the internet for vans. We set a budget of $2,000 (lol), planning on this being our "starter van". If we liked it, we would upgrade in a few years to a Sprinter.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">We went to test-drive a sweet 1987 chocolate-and-raspberry colored conversion van. It looked fantastic in pictures and the seller seemed open to negotiation on price. We drove out to Cherryville for a test-drive, and everything seemed great in the parking lot. We were ecstatic. But then we took it on the road.... the steering was very loose at higher speeds and did not feel safe. The parking brake light was on, and the owner tried to play it off, but we're vairly sure it was seized, causing the van to veer. We passed.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">Then, we found a 1994 conversion van in Asheville, at a used car dealership, for $4,500. It was silver and light blue and beautiful. We got there when the dealership opened, only to find that they had been robbed the night before and the thieves took off with a bunch of keys. This was the second time this had happened, as the owner "didn't believe" in security cameras, which did not instill confidence. We drove home, and the dealership was going to call us when they got new keys made. We decided we didn't want to drive back to Asheville again, and were going to search locally.</p>

    <div class="info-left">

        <p class="paragraph">Then we found Tilde on Facebook Marketplace. Being a 1997, she didn't have the vintage look I wanted and the price was higher ($4,000), but newer = more reliable, so we went to check her out. The couple selling her were about our age and had had the same plans, but life got in the way and so they decided to sell her. She was already gutted on the inside, saving us some work, and the front seats were extra cozy. I was apprehensive, because she wasn't as "instagramable" as a more vintage van and y'know, she was twice our "budget." Andy told me neither points were valid, of course. We realized out budget wasn't realistic for a van that wouldn't have too many issues.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">So we slept on it. And I couldn't stop thinking about her. And I hated it. I had had this idea in my head about the van we would get and she didn't fit that picture. But I knew we couldn't risk someone else snatching her up. I reached out to the seller the next morning and we negotiated to $3,500. Showed up with cash, got some papers notarized at UPS, and she was ours! The AC broke a week later, of course.</p>

            <li><span class="bold">ADVICE: </span>Never buy right away. Always sleep on it.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">REMEMBER: </span>Trust your gut. If it seems too good to be true, it likely is.</li>
